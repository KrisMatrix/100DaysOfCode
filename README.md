# 100DaysOfCode

Although I know both Perl and Python well, I wanted to take the 100 Day of Code challenge from Angela Yu's Python course and see what I could learn. I typically prefer Perl to Python unless I am doing DataScience (a domain where Python is generally better and easier to use). And while I understand the benefits and draw backs of a number of languages at a basic level, I wanted to challenge myself to write the same program in Perl and Python. This repository consists of two directories - one for Python, one for Perl - consisting of the same projects but written in Python and Perl respectively. 

Perl's popularity is supposedly fading, but Python's continues to rise, and while I still prefer the former to the latter when programming, I wanted to challenge myself to make programs in Python.
